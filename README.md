# iOS Developer Nanodegree - Project 3 - On The Map

On The Map allows users to share their location and a URL with their fellow students. To visualize this data, On The Map uses a map with pins for location and pin annotations for student names and URLs, allowing students to place themselves “on the map,” so to speak.

This is the third project for Udacity's iOS Developer Nanodegree.
